        <p>In this task *metrics will develop a registry of social media platforms that are used for scholarly
            communication. The registry will include platforms that were created specifically for scientific use, as well
            as general purpose platforms that are now commonly used by scientists for dissemination of their research
            results. For all services, we will describe:</p>
        <ul class="paragraph-list">
            <li>which functions of scholarly communication they support,</li>
            <li>which interactions are possible, and</li>
            <li>what meaningful metrics possess could build upon capturing these interactions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The registry will also provide a detailed overview on currently offered *metrics aggregators and a
            comparision of the information that is offered by these services.
            This development will support two other important tasks in the project</p>
